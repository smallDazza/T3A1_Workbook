## Question 1 Answer:
A standard source control process for a large project will be based on what source control system the project development team are currently using and would most likely be the mostly used VCS system of Git and then the mostly used Git repositories of GitHub or Bitbucket. This VCS software is used by the development team to manage changes in the projects source code over the length of time the project takes to complete.
The development team process for the VCS of the project will be applying a number of standard practices, these are:

    - Repository Setup: organising the structure of the code into clear and consistent repositories.
    - Branching Strategies: to manage code changes a good branch strategy is required. This could be having a 'main' branch for production ready code, a 'dev' branch for ongoing developement and testing, then creating new branches as required for future version releases or bug fixes where these can be merged back into the main branch when finished.
    - Commit Messages & Frequency: when team members are commiting changes they need to write concise and informative messages. This way other members of the team will know and understand what they have done. Members should also be instructed to make regular frequent small commits rather than infrequent larger commits. This makes tracking changes and identification of bugs easier for all team members.
    - Review Of Code: code review practices should be implemented for team members to catch errors, share knowledge and check the code quality adheres to current best practices & standards.
    - Using Pull Requests: team members should use pull requests for all code changes. These pull requests can be used for reviewing code, testing and code quality reviews before merging them back into the 'main' branch.
    -  CI/CD Processes: a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment process should be implemented. This involves a pipeline to trigger the automation of the building, testing and deployment of code changes to the dev environment.
    - Resolving Conflicts: all team members should work together to resolve any merging conflicts quickly when they happen. These conflicts happen when different members have modified the same part of a file.
    - .gitignore File: To specifically have any file or directories ignored by the VCS software, member should use a .gitignore file.
    - Security: access control measures should be used by the dev team to protect the main production branch. This security should help prevent things like deletions, direct pushing to production and unauthorised access.
    - Cleanup Process: a branch cleanup process should be regularly done to remove old & unused branches. This will maintain a managable and clean repository.
    - Documentation: The repository should include a documentation file or README file to guide any new or current dev team members of the processes of building, running, testing and cloning any part of the software project.

## Question 2 Answer:
There are a number of important aspects to quality software, these are:
1. Reliability: Software must be available for use all the time and able to perform as expected and still function under heavy usage loads. This also includes the ability to recover quickly and efficiently should faults or failures happen. The best way to achieve reliability is through testing and debugging methods to ensure it functions as intended and if any errors are detected they can be resolved before released to a production environment. 
    - A demonstration example of this would be if a software server goes down, then the software system needs to automatically changeover to another duplicate server to continue the reliability and functionality of the software program.
2. Usability:   This aspect refers to the end users experience when using the software or its User Interface (UI). The UI should be easy to understand and use for all types of end users, from experienced to novice users. This is achieved in the UI design which should be organised in a way that makes it easy to find what the user is looking for, read and understand all text displayed and any buttons easily accessible for selection.
    - A demonstration example of this would be in a ecommerce website, for allowing customers to do refunds/returns, would be making sure the button to allow this is in a prominent position next to each of the customers ordered items. Not in a obscure different area that is not related to the customers ordered products. 
3. Portability: For this to be achieved the software must be available for use on all different types of environments containing different hardware or operating systems. This is most commonly required for use in mobile applications where the software would need to function and render in both Android and IOS environments.
    - A demonstration example of this would be for a application to work on both Android and IOS mobile environments, would be to use cross-platform development frameworks like Flutter or React Native. These tools allow you to write a single codebase that works on both platforms, saving time and resources.
4. Maintainability: This refers to how easily the software can be maintained and updated when developers are wanting to add new features or update existing features. Good software design architecture is required for this aspect with principles being used such as reuse of code and modularity, which will make it easier to modify and update the software code.
    - A demonstration example of this would be the development team using a VCS system such as Git/GitHub. This way the main source code is confidently always updated and documented with the different versions everytime a new version is released. 
5. Efficiency:  The performance efficiency of the software is very important as this is how quickly and accurately it performs the tasks required. To achieve this good effective coding principles and techniques need to be achieved to avoid errors that can slow the system down. Also the efficiency on the system resources such as CPU usage, memory and disk space need to be considered and monitored when the software is being used.
    - A demonstration example of this would be the dev team using coding principles such as KISS (Keep It Super Simple) & DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) for the simplest coding solutions and removing duplication for a clean codebase. Also using a powerful software development approach like the Test Driven Development (TDD) approach, which involves a short, repeatable development cycles, will greatly improve software efficiency.
6. Security:   One of the most important aspects in the quality of software is its security and its ability to ensure it is safe from unauthorised access, data deletion and data tampering. Ensuring authentication, authorisation and data encryption coding techniques are used to ensure the entegrity of the software data and controlling who has access to this is very important.
    - A demonstration example of this would be if the software has an API endpoint that is exposed to the public. To secure this endpoint and the software system from unauthorised access, the use of a JWT security token should be implemented so only authorised user with the security token can gain access to the endpoint & system.

## Question 3 Answers:
A standard high level structure of a MERN stack application would be as follows:
- Overview: A popular full stack used for web applications is a MERN stack. This is a powerful javascript stack which allows developers to build scalable web applications and contains the four technologies of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js.
These four technologies work together to create a three tier architecture pattern called Model View Controller (or MVC). The Model component is the database tier for managing and storing data. The View is the component for displaying the data or front end tier. The Controller is the back end tier and component used for handling user input and updating both the Model & View components as required. All techs use javascript & JSON format which all combine together as in this image and explanation:
    - ![MERN Stack](./images/MERN%20stack.png)
    - Front End Tier;
        - React.js: React is a javascript library that allows developers to build front end user interfaces (UIs) for web applications. It does this by using individual pieces called components, written in javascript, and then combined to render and update as the applications data changes. 
    - Back End Tier;
        - Express.js and Node.js: These both use javascript and work together by running the Express framework inside a Node server. Node.js is used to create a server side environment which will offer back end application functionalities like creating API's, automation & scripting and real time streaming app services etc. Express is a small framework that sits on top of Node.js and enables web application functionality to handle a variety of different HTTP requests. Express also is customisable and permits integration tools and features from other third parties. Both these combined create a seamless back end connectivity environment that is highly scalable and effiicent. 
    - Database Tier;
        - MongoDB: Is a NoSQL database where data is stored in flexable JSON like documents. This document model maps to javascript objects in the applications code. So user JSON documents created in the React.js front end UI can be sent to the server and provided they are valid, will be processed by Express.js and stored directly in the MongoDB database where they can be retrieved later when required.

- MERN Stack Project Structure: Project structure using the MVC architecture pattern is organised in a way that separates the front end code from the back end code. Doing this creates a well organised and maintainable project code structure that improves readability for time saving development but also allows greater future scalability. This is done by creating separate directories for both client side and server side components.
    - Client Side Structure: The client file directory will contain all files and code relating to the front end tier of the application. These could be in a structure like this:
        - Client directory:
            - public folder: This contains files relating to images, fonts and HTML. The index.html file would be located here which is the entry point for React.js.
            - src folder: This file contains the main source code for the front end of the application. Its sub folders & files would be:
                - components: Contains reusable UI components for use across multiple application pages.
                - pages: Each application page can have its own designated folder here with code and logic specific for that page.
                - services: This file will contain all files and code used for services like API functionality and data fetching.
                - utils: Any helper or utility files required can be placed in this folder.
                - App.js file: This file is a container for global initialisation and routing by React.js.
                - index.js file: React.js uses this file for rendering and mounting it into the DOM.
                - .env file: This file contains the environment specific configurations. For EG; database credentials, API Keys.
                - package.json file: This file can be used for adding & running scripts for testing and starting the server.
    - Server Side Structure: The server file directory will contain all files and code relating to the back end tier of the application. These would be in a structure like this:
        - Server directory:
            - config: This holds the back end configuration files, such as environment variables and database connection settings.
            - controllers: This folder will contain the files for each controller route which conatins the logic for handling http requests and data processing.
            - models: Database schemas can be contained in this folder. Each model file contains specific data structure and controls the interactions with the database.
            - routes: The applications API routes are located in this folder. These files are responsible for defining each routes endpoints, mapping them to the correct controller functions and handling the request authentication and validation.
            - server.js file: This is the back end entry point for the Express server and establishing the middleware configs and database connections.

## Question 4 Answers:
There are many different aspects required for developing a website for a small business. Overall the team will need some or all of the following knowledge and skillsets to develop the project:

1. Client Requirements and Research :
    - First steps in any project is a team member(s) will need to have the abilities to sit down and have a meeting with the client and put together a project website brief for meeting all the clients expectations for their website. The planning for this project brief will need to include the following aspects:
        - Identify the goals and objectives of the website. For example what problems is this website going to resolve ?
        - The clients website requirements will need to be defined. These will be a list of the clients requirements, user requirements and outcomes, considering any business industry standards, any market research to be conducted, and if required any third party integrations. 
        - Will need to define the project scope. This project scope is a roadmap of the entire project plan and will include all the functions, contraints and exclusions required.
2. Project Planning:
    - The knowledge and skillsets required in this stage are based on the outcomes in step 1, which is to document a project plan. This plan will include important aspects like:
        - Choosing an appropriate project management methodology that aligns with the project requirements and scope. Will the project be agile or waterfall ? if agile what type of framework will suit the development team, Scrum , Lean or Kanban ?
        - Performing a project risk assessment is also very important. This will evaluate the likelihood and impact of any potential risks and challenges that could affect the projects succesful outcome, while also developing contingency plans if these were to happen.
        - Task management and scheduling of the project will enable the team better progress allocation of resources, task completion dates, estimation of task outcomes and an overall tracking of the entire project for dev team and client management.      
3. Legal Obligations & Project Costings:
    - These next two aspects may or may not be something the actual development team can perform and if not, then outside third party professionals will need to be consulted.  Based on stage twos outcomes the costings will need to be quoted and provded to the client for projects approval and go ahead. Any legal obligations that the clients business has to conform with will also then have to be reflected and added to the projects planning and scope, as this will reduce or negate any future legalities casued by the clients website. 
4. Designing:
    - The dev team will need to have the knowledge and ability to perform the websites UX / UI design. The development team should know the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design principles, as this will impact on the users engagement and outcomes. Its important to create a website that is both visually appealing and easy to use.
    - The dev team will also need to have the skillset of building design charts/diagrams for the project. These are important for the projects requirements and building development for the next stage. Examples of these could be use case diagrams, website flowchart for the processes of the website. Commonly used UML diagrams such as Class diagrams and Sequence diagrams will be required for the actual coding of the project. If the website is storing user data then a ER Diagram will also be needed for the building of the database. 
5. Building and Maintaining:
    - This stage is where the developement team members will actually code or build the projects website. The knowledge and skillsets required here by the dev team will be:
        - Proficiency and skill in programming languages. The developers will need to be proficient in programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as a good understanding of these languages is essential for creating and maintaining the website.
        - Knowledge of frameworks and libraries. Besides the programming languages, the developers should be familiar with frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Svelte. These tools make it easier to develop and can help the development team save time and effort on building the website.
6. Testing:
    - The dev team here will require testing and debugging skills. Before going live and releasing to the client, developers will be required to test and debug their code to ensure the website functions correctly. This requires attention to detail and the ability to identify and fix errors in the code.
7. Communication and Teamwork:
    - Overall the knowledge here for the development team as a whole, and also as individuals, will need to work collaboratively as a team. Team members should have strong communication and teamwork skills. They should be able to work in a team environment but also trusted and the abilities to work alone on tasks as required.

## Question 5 Answers:
The knowledge and skills required for a work project I was invloved in and the challenges I had to overcome are mentioned below:
- The Work Project: A couple of years ago in the current company I am employed with, I was asked to join the product management team to work on a new project of building a new cloud software application based on the companies current dot net windows software application.
- Knowledge & Skills Required: The knowledge and skills required for my part in the project was the following:
    1. Software workflow knowledge of the current application and how this will need to be similarly transitioned across to the new cloud application.
    2. Documentation skills for the workflow of the new cloud application and how this can be improved, based on current software application customer feedback and complaints.
    3. Based on the knowledge of current software application UI / UX design, contribute to the design and documentation of the new cloud applications UI / UX features.
    4. Knowledge of the current third party software integration partners and how the data from these interact with the data of our current software application.
    5. Document, advise and improve on how the data from these software integration partners will be handled in the new cloud application.
    6. Task management program knowledge and skill that the development team were using, which was the Atlassian program of Jira. 
    7. Communication skills in both writing and speaking with meetings of the different groups invloved in the project being the Dev team, company management, integration partners and customers involved in beta testing.
    8. Team work knowledge and skill to work together with all the different aspects and personalities that come with multiple different team members to see the project outcomes achieved in the project areas I was invloved in. 
- Challenges To Overcome: With my background being from leading the current software training team and managing client software requests there were a number of new challenges I had to work through in my new role on the project management team. These were:
    1. Documentation: Specifically researching and learning how to document the workflow for the new cloud application, by the way of diagrams & charts, so the dev team would be able to interpret these correctly. These mostly were UML software behavioral diagrams such as use case, activity diagrams and flowchart diagram.
    2. Design: This was the most challenging aspect for me, as I had never been involved in any sort of designing features or UI / UX design and functionality before. Therefore i was more like a junior in helping in this area and took my instructions and learning from more experienced team members. The areas mostly helped out with here were the initial cloud applications site mapping and appliction page wire frame layouts to be very similar or improved on from the current software.
    3. Integration Data: A couple of our integration partners advised our dev team that they had now created and developed new API endpoints for our software to use and move away from the current SQL database connections our current software was using. So the project manangement and dev teams decided to incorporate these new endpoints into the new cloud application. Having at the time no software developemnt or coding experience, the only understanding I had (from just years of experience) was the basic SQL data fields & formats used for these integration partners. So this was another on the job challenge and learning from the dev team members of how to use the Postman and swagger programs to check the API endpoint data we were given access to, was correct for use in the cloud application.
